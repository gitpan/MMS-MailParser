MMS-MailParser

This class takes an MMS message and parses it into two 'standard' formats (an MMS::MailMessage and MMS::MailMessage::ProviderParsed) for further use.  It is intended to make parsing MMS messages network/provider agnostic such that a 'standard' object results from parsing, independant of the net-work/provider it was sent through.

NOTE : THIS PACKAGE CONTAINS SAMPLE MESSAGES FOR EACH NETWORK PROVIDER AND THUS CAN BE A LARGE DOWNLOAD
